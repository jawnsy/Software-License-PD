=head1 DESCRIPTION

In legal circles, B<Public Domain> is defined as the absence of B<copyright>
(and therefore precludes the need for any B<license>). Artistic works enter
the Public Domain in two common situations:

=over

=item 1

Where the work carries no license or copyright information, and precedes
the ratification of the I<Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary
and Artistic Works>

=item 2

Where the term of copyright has lapsed, the length of which varies between
jurisdictions

=back

Some authors have chosen to disclaim all rights to their works and attempt
to release them into the Public Domain. This is a particularly contentious
issue because some jurisdictions do not recognize an author's perogative to
disclaim all rights to their own work. In European countries, authors can
abandon their claim to copyright, but not Reputation Rights (which prevent
people from removing your name from your work, among other things).

While I have researched the issue to some extent, I am not a lawyer and am
not qualified to provide legal advice. I have used this license for some of
my own packages, but am unsure whether it would stand up in a court of law.

=head2 CREATIVE COMMONS ZERO

The B<Creative Commons Zero> (CC0) license is an extremely liberal license,
which confers rights similar to Public Domain to the extent permissible by
law. However, Creative Commons does not recommend the application of their
licenses to software, see:
L<http://wiki.creativecommons.org/FAQ#Can_I_use_a_Creative_Commons_license_for_software.3F>

=head1 NOTABLE PROJECTS

Several notable Open Source software projects have been released into the
Public Domain:

SQLite, L<http://sqlite.org>

L<Math::Random::ISAAC>, as well as the algorithm and accompanying reference
implementation, L<http://burtleburtle.net/bob/rand/isaacafa.html>
